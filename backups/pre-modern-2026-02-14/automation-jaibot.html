              <h1>JAIBOT — Personal AI Assistant</h1>
              <p>
                A personal AI assistant designed to combine contextual knowledge about my professional profile
                with practical automation capabilities for everyday tasks.
              </p>
            </header>

            <!-- OVERVIEW -->
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>

            <p>
              The idea behind JAIBOT was born from two recurring problems I kept encountering, both as a professional
              and as a curious builder exploring automation and AI.
            </p>

                src="images/portal_streamlit.png"
                alt="JAIBOT overview"
                style="width:40%; display:block; margin:0 auto;"
                />
            </a>
            </span>


            <h3>Problem 1 — Static personal profiles</h3>
            <p>
              When you want to introduce yourself professionally, you usually rely on static formats:
              CVs, portfolios, LinkedIn profiles or presentations.
              While useful, they often lack flexibility and depth.
              What happens when someone wants to explore a very specific aspect of your experience?
              Or ask follow-up questions tailored to their own interests?
            </p>

            <p>
              This is where AI shows one of its greatest strengths: contextual understanding and personalization.
              The idea was to create an assistant capable of answering questions about me,
              my background, skills and projects, adapting responses dynamically
              based on a rich, curated context.
              A recruiter, a hiring manager or anyone interested in my profile
              could explore it in a much more natural and interactive way.
            </p>

            <h3>Problem 2 — Efficiency and focus</h3>
            <p>
              As professionals, our goal is to become better, more efficient and to focus our time
              on what really matters.
              But day-to-day tasks keep piling up: emails, task organization, research, reminders,
              monitoring tools and events.
            </p>

            <p>
              I started exploring the idea of a personal assistant capable of listening to events,
              processing inputs and either informing me or taking action based on my preferences.
              Connected to the right tools, such an assistant could reduce friction and centralize
              many workflows in one place.
              With AI, there are (almost) no real limits to what this assistant could do.
            </p>

            <p>
              Combining both ideas led to a single solution:
              a unified assistant that works both as an interactive professional profile
              and as a practical personal automation hub.
              This is how JAIBOT — <em>Jaime’s assistant</em> — was born.
            </p>

            <!-- TECHNICAL OVERVIEW -->
            <h2>Technical Overview</h2>

            <p>
              JAIBOT Lite is built around a local-first architecture with a strong focus on flexibility,
              modularity and low operational cost.
              The core logic is orchestrated using workflow automation, allowing the assistant to grow
              and evolve incrementally.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Streamlit</strong> acts as the user-facing interface.</li>
              <li><strong>n8n</strong> orchestrates the automation flows and decision logic.</li>
              <li><strong>LLMs</strong> handle natural language understanding and response generation.</li>
              <li><strong>Local services</strong> are prioritized to reduce cost and maintain control.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The user interacts with JAIBOT through a simple web interface.
              Requests are sent to n8n, which manages validation, routing,
              AI execution and response handling before sending the final answer back to the UI.
            </p>

        
            <!-- ARCHITECTURE CONSTRAINTS -->
            <h2>Architecture Decisions & Constraints</h2>

            <p>
              I am fully aware that certain parts of the architecture could be more efficient
              or scalable in a production-grade environment.
              However, it is important to understand the constraints and goals of this project.
            </p>

            <p>
              One of the main challenges was keeping the solution as low-cost as possible.
              For that reason, most services run locally and the system avoids
              unnecessary cloud dependencies.
              This local-first approach introduces certain limitations and additional complexity,
              especially when it comes to availability and long-running services.
            </p>

            <p>
              In future phases, once I reach the level of knowledge and confidence I aim for
              in automation and system design,
              I plan to explore cloud deployments and hybrid setups.
              This would allow JAIBOT to operate 24/7 without local constraints
              and open the door to more advanced use cases.
            </p>

            <!-- WORKFLOW DETAILS -->
            <h2>Workflow Breakdown</h2>

<p>
  JAIBOT Lite is not just a chatbot sitting behind a UI.
  Under the hood, it is a small orchestration system that connects a conversational interface,
  an automation engine and an LLM platform designed to handle context, state and multi-step reasoning.
  The complexity is intentionally hidden from the user, but very present in the architecture.
</p>

<h3>0. High-level architecture</h3>

<p>
  The system is built around four core layers:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Streamlit</strong> as the user-facing interface.</li>
  <li><strong>n8n</strong> as the orchestration and automation engine.</li>
  <li><strong>OpenAI Platform (Assistants API)</strong> as the conversational and reasoning core.</li>
  <li><strong>External tools & services</strong> (Gmail, Calendar, Notion, etc.) connected via APIs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The user interacts only with Streamlit.
  Everything else — validation, context management, retries, AI execution and integrations —
  is handled asynchronously through workflows.
</p>

<h3>1. Entry point — Webhook & request validation</h3>

<p>
  Every interaction starts with a webhook exposed by n8n.
  Streamlit sends the user message as a structured payload, which immediately goes through
  a validation layer.
</p>

<p>
  At this stage, the workflow checks:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>That the request is authorized (simple auth key / environment check).</li>
  <li>That the payload structure is correct.</li>
  <li>That mandatory fields (message, context flags, metadata) are present.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Invalid or malformed requests are rejected early to avoid unnecessary AI calls
  and reduce cost and noise in the system.
</p>

<h3>2. Context management & identity awareness</h3>

<p>
  One of the key design decisions was to make JAIBOT aware of <em>who</em> is talking to it.
  The assistant behaves differently depending on whether the user is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A generic external user exploring my profile.</li>
  <li>Or myself, using JAIBOT as a personal assistant.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This differentiation is handled through contextual signals passed to the LLM,
  not through hardcoded logic.
  The idea is to let the assistant reason based on context, not on rigid condition trees.
</p>

<h3>3. OpenAI Assistants API (not a “vanilla” LLM call)</h3>

<p>
  Instead of calling a raw completion or chat model, JAIBOT uses the
  <strong>OpenAI Assistants API</strong>.
  This was a deliberate choice.
</p>

<p>
  The Assistants API allows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Persistent threads to maintain conversational state.</li>
  <li>Rich system instructions that define behavior and boundaries.</li>
  <li>External documents and context files attached to the assistant.</li>
  <li>A clear separation between user input and assistant reasoning.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This means that API calls are structurally different from a simple “prompt → response” flow.
  Each interaction involves:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creating or reusing a thread.</li>
  <li>Appending a new message to that thread.</li>
  <li>Triggering a run.</li>
  <li>Polling for completion.</li>
  <li>Fetching and post-processing the assistant output.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  While more complex, this approach provides much better control over context,
  behavior consistency and long-term scalability.
</p>

<h3>4. Orchestration logic in n8n</h3>

<p>
  n8n acts as the brain of the system.
  It orchestrates the entire lifecycle of each interaction:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creating threads and runs.</li>
  <li>Waiting and polling for execution status.</li>
  <li>Handling timeouts and retries.</li>
  <li>Cleaning and formatting responses.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Conditional nodes are used to manage asynchronous behavior.
  If a run is not completed, the workflow waits and checks again,
  avoiding race conditions or partial responses.
</p>

<p>
  This approach trades simplicity for reliability — a conscious decision
  aligned with real-world automation constraints.
</p>

<h3>5. External tools & API integrations (work in progress)</h3>

<p>
  Beyond conversational capabilities, JAIBOT is designed to act as a true assistant
  connected to my daily tools:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gmail</li>
  <li>Google Calendar</li>
  <li>Notion</li>
  <li>Other services exposed via APIs</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The technical groundwork is already in place:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Credentials management.</li>
  <li>Secure API connections.</li>
  <li>Event-based triggers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  What remains is the most sensitive part:
  ensuring that the AI makes the <strong>right decision at the right time</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  A single ambiguous word in a message — especially when interacting with clients or external contacts —
  could lead to incorrect or harmful actions.
  Because of that, this layer requires extremely tight constraints,
  clear intent detection and conservative decision-making.
</p>

<p>
  This is currently the main focus of iteration and refinement.
</p>

<h3>6. Local-first architecture & infrastructure challenges</h3>

<p>
  One of the biggest constraints — and learning opportunities — of JAIBOT Lite
  is that most of the system runs locally.
</p>

<p>
  To expose local services (like n8n) securely, the project uses
  <strong>Cloudflare Tunnel</strong> as a bridge between local infrastructure
  and external APIs.
</p>

<p>
  This setup introduces real-world limitations:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The system depends on my machine being powered on.</li>
  <li>Network stability becomes a critical factor.</li>
  <li>Long-running automations are harder to guarantee.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  However, working under these constraints has been extremely valuable.
  It mirrors the challenges faced by individuals or small teams
  without access to large-scale infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
  Understanding how to adapt, simplify and prioritize under these conditions
  is part of the learning goal of this project.
</p>

<h3>7. Proof of Concept today, scalable system tomorrow</h3>

<p>
  JAIBOT Lite is intentionally a <strong>proof of concept</strong>.
  The objective is not perfection, but learning through real implementation.
</p>

<p>
  In a future phase, the plan is to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move core services to cloud infrastructure.</li>
  <li>Ensure 24/7 availability.</li>
  <li>Harden decision-making logic.</li>
  <li>Expand integrations safely.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For now, the focus remains on understanding the full lifecycle of an AI-driven system:
  from UX to orchestration, from infrastructure constraints to responsible automation.
